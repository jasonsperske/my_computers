  "about": "<p>I joined a small team of 5 to help create a shippable Web Component, a devloper hub to manage thier applicaitons and various support functions like a blog, build infrastructure, AMPScript emails all to bring Grammalry for Developers to market.</p><p>I worked on every level of the applicaiton including parts of it's backend written in Java and Scala. As we approached our \"Go Live\" date I created an Easter Egg (in the style of Microsoft's Windows 95 secret) to commemorate the acheivement of the incredable people who helped get our product ready.</p>",
  "stack": "<p>developer.grammarly.com was built entirely in <code>Vue 3.2</code>, the WebComponent was built in <code>React</code> and the app server was built in <code>Java</code>.  There is a heavy empasis on <code>JavaScript</code> (and <code>AJAX</code> patterns) for data views (which can be seen in the screen casts). The Content Management system is a <code>Java Web Application</code> (written for Tomcat 7) and uses the <code>Twitter Bootstrap</code> CSS framework.</p>",
